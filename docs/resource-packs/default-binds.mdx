title: Default Binds

# What is it?

The default binding of the `Controls` found in controller settings is completely data-driven.
You can override the defaults for all controllers or specific controller namespaces.

For example, by default, the `Jump` action is bound to the south face button on all controllers.
This is 'A' on Xbox, or 'Cross' on PlayStation. This is defined within the built-in mod resource pack.

# Creating the definition

Below is an example that sets 'Jump' to the south button,
'Walk Forward' to pushing the left stick upwards,
and unbinding the 'Open Inventory' action.
```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "controlify:jump": {
      "button": "controlify:button/south"
    },
    "controlify:walk_forward": {
      "axis": "controlify:axis/left_stick_up"
    },
    "controlify:inventory": {
      "type": "empty"
    }
  }
}
```

- If you would like your definition to apply to all controllers, you would put the example in the file
`/assets/controlify/controllers/default_bind/default.json`
- If you would like your definition to apply to a [specific controller namespace](custom-controller-identification)
(e.g. my_resource_pack:switch), you would put the example in the file
`/assets/my_resource_pack/controllers/default_bind/switch.json`

What is *not* data-driven is the bindings themselves, like `controlify:jump`. These are registered in code
within the mod. Other mods can also register their own actions, like `generic_backpack_mod:open_backpack`.
