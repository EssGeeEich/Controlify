title: Custom Controller Identification
---

# What is it?

Controlify allows you to create custom definitions for your controller.

Creating a custom definition allows you to define a **specific name** for your controller model,
**a sprite texture** (like the ones you see in the controller select screen),
[**default bindings**](default-binds) specific to your controller,
an [**input glyph set**](input-glyphs),
and [**special mappings**](input-mappings) for controllers like flight-sticks.

# Creating the definition

In your resource pack, create the file `/assets/controlify/controllers/controller_identification.json5`.
Unlike most resources in Minecraft, this file is **additive** and **does not overwrite** the base definitions
provided by Controlify. All resource packs are loaded and their definitions are *added* to the definition
list.

<Callout variant="info">
Ensure the file extension is **.json5**, and NOT `.json`.
If you don't know what JSON5 is, don't worry, it's compatible with regular json,
so use it as you normally would JSON.
</Callout>

Here is a definition for Switch Pro controllers.
```json5
[
  {
    "name": "Switch Controller",
    "namespace": "my_resource_pack:switch",

    "hids": [
      [0x57e, 0x2009], // this array must contain exactly two elements: VID and PID
    ]
  }
]
```
Here you can see that the name of the controller is defined as `Switch Controller`, and a namespace
has been defined for this controller `my_resource_pack:switch`. This is used elsewhere in resource pack features
so take note of what you call it. You should set `my_resource_pack` to a string that will be unique to your resource
pack, to prevent conflicts with other resource packs.

`"hids"` is the most important part. Each USB and Bluetooth device model have unique identifiers:
**Vendor ID (VID)** and **Product ID (PID)**. Each manufacturer reserves a specific VID, and each of their
devices have their own PID. In the case of a Switch Pro Controller, Nintendo's VID is `0x57e` and the
controller's PID is `0x2009`. This is defined as a json array: `[0x57e, 0x2009]`.

## Finding your controller's VID and PID

Even without a custom definition, Controlify will still attempt to load your controller.
When it does so, it adds the VID and PID information into a *debug dump* that you can retrieve from the
**Global Settings** of Controlify. Inside, you will find the information you need.

# Done!

You have now successfully created a custom controller definition!
Restart the game to see that your controller is now using your custom name!

If you'd like to customise your custom controller further with features mentioned at the start of this page,
check the sidebar for pages on how to do so.

# Adding to built-in namespaces

Your resource pack can extend these definitions and add additional VID and PIDs to them. Exclude the `"name"` property
for the definition for Controlify to use the built-in name.

```json5
[
  {
    "namespace": "controlify:xbox_one",
    "hids": [
      [0x01, 0x10] // additional HID added to xbox_one
    ]
  }
]
```

For a list of all the built-in definitions,
see the [Built-in Controller Namespaces](../reference/builtin-controller-namespaces) page.
