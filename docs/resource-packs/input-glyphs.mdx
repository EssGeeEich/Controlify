title: Input Glyphs
---

# What is it?

Input glyphs are the icons that represent the buttons on your controller.
Controlify has many built-in glyph sets for common controllers, but you can also create your own.

<div className={"flex flex-row justify-center flex-wrap max-w-full md:flex-col"}>
    <Asset className={"rounded-sm"} width={1020 / 2} location="images:options-button-with-glyph" />
</div>

These glyphs are actually their own font, and you create them the same way as any other font in a resource pack.
All you need to turn it into a controller glyph set is one extra file in the resource pack to link it together.

# Creating a custom glyph set

## 1. Create the font file

<Callout>
    **Refer to the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Font#Providers) for information on creating fonts.**
    This wiki will help you understand how to create a font file and how all the providers work.
</Callout>

To create a glpyh set for the controller namespace `my_resource_pack:switch`,
create a font file in your resource pack, like `/assets/my_resource_pack/font/controller/switch.json`.

```json5
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "type": "bitmap",
      "file": "my_resource_pack:font/controller/switch.png",
      "ascent": 11, // how many pixels should be above the baseline
      "height": 16, // the height of each glyph, mine will be 16x,
      "chars": [
        // a map of characters positioned in an image, each element in this array is a row
        // these characters can be any unicode character, but they must match to step 3
        "\u0001\u0002",
        "\u0003\u0004"
        // The above defines a 2x2 grid of characters, each character is 16x16 pixels
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2. Create the texture file

As per the `"file"` entry in your font file, create a texture file in your resource pack.
**Make sure to place it in the `textures` folder.**

In this case, `assets/my_resource_pack/textures/font/controller/switch.png`.

<div className={"flex flex-row justify-center flex-wrap max-w-full md:flex-col"}>
    <Asset className={"rounded-sm"} width={1020 / 2} location="images:button-glyph-atlas" />
</div>

## 3. Create the glyph font mapping

Finally, create a file that links the [controller inputs](../reference/builtin-inputs) to the characters you
defined in the font file.

A switch controller uses the face button layout
```
   X
Y     A
   B
```
- `controlify:button/north` is `X`
- `controlify:button/east` is `A`
- `controlify:button/south` is `B`
- `controlify:button/west` is `Y`

Create a file in your resource pack, like `/assets/my_resource_pack/controllers/font_mappings/switch.json`.
```json5
{
  "controlify:button/north": "\u0004",
  "controlify:button/east": "\u0003",
  "controlify:button/south": "\u0002",
  "controlify:button/west": "\u0001"
}
```

## 4. Done!

You have now successfully created a custom glyph set for your controller! Test it out in game!

# Overriding existing glyph sets

To override an existing built-in glyph set, just follow the same steps as above, but use the same namespace as the built-in one.
